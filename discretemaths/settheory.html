Set theory is the branch of mathematical logic that studies sets, which are collections of objects.

<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Applications of Set Theory</strong></span>
<ul>
	<li>Although any type of object can be collected into a set, set theory is applied most often to objects that are relevant to mathematics. The language of set theory can be used in the definitions of nearly all mathematical objects.</li>
	<li>Set theory is commonly employed as a foundational system for mathematics, particularly in the form of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice.</li>
	<li>Beyond its foundational role, set theory is a branch of mathematics in its own right, with an active research community.</li>
	<li>Contemporary research into set theory includes a diverse collection of topics, ranging from the structure of the real number line to the study of the consistency of large cardinals.</li>
