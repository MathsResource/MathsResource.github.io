<h2>Measures of Centrality</h2>

<ul>
<li>Measures of centrality give one representative number for the location of the centre of the distribution of data.
\item
The most common measures are the <b><i>sample mean}} and the <b><i> sample median }}.
<li>We must make a distinction between a sample mean and a population mean: The sample mean is simply the average of all the items in a sample.  \smallskip <li>The population mean (often represented by the Greek letter $\mu$) is simply the average of all the items in a population. <li>Because a population is usually very large, the population mean is usually an unknown constant.

<li>We will return to the matter of population means in due course. For now, we will look at sample means.
</ul>

<h4>Sample Mean<h4>

<ul>
<li>The sample mean is an estimator available for estimating the population mean $\mu$. 
It is a measure of location, commonly called the average, often denoted $\bar{x}$, where $x$ is the data set.
\item
Its value depends equally on all of the data which may include outliers. It may not appear representative of the central region for skewed data sets.
\item
It is especially useful as being representative of the whole sample for use in subsequent calculations.
<li>The sample mean of a data set is defined as :
\[ \bar{x} = { \sum x_i\over n}\]
<li>$\sum x_i$ is the summation of al the elements of $x$, and $n$ is the sample size.
</ul>

<h4>Computing the sample mean</h4>

Suppose we roll a die 8 times and get the following scores: $x = \{ 5, 2, 1, 6, 3, 5, 3, 1\}$ \\ \bigskip

What is the sample mean of the scores $\bar{x}$?
\[ \bar{x}  = {5 + 2 +  1 +  6 +  3 +  5 +  3 +  1 \over 8 } = {26 \over 8} =  3.25 \]










<!---------------------------------------------------------------->
<h3>Median</h3>

<ul>
<li> The other commonly used measure of centrality is the median.</li>
<li> The median is the value halfway through the ordered data set, below and above which there lies an equal number of data values.</li>
<li> For an odd sized data set, the median is the middle element of the <b><i>ordered</b></i> data set.</li>
<li> For an even sized data set, the median is the average of the middle pair of elements of an \t{ordered} data set.</li>
<li> It is generally a good descriptive measure of the location which works well for <b><i>skewed data</b></i>, or data with <b><i>outliers</b></i>.</li>
<li> For later, the median is the 0.5 quantile, and the second quartile <i>Q_2</i>.
</ul>
<h4> Odd Sized Data Set</h4>

With an odd number of data values, for example nine, we have:
<ul>
<li> Data : {96, 48, 27, 72, 39, 70, 7, 68, 99 }</li>
<li> Ordered Data :  {7, 27, 39, 48, 68, 70, 72, 96, 99}</li>
<li> Median : 68, leaving four values below and four values above</li>
</ul>
<h4> Even Sized Data Set</h4>
With an even number of data values, for example 8, we have:
<ul>
<li> Data : {96, 48 ,27 ,72, 39, 70, 7, 68 }
<li> Ordered Data :{7, 27, 39, 48, 68, 70, 72, 96}
<li> Median : Halfway between the two 'middle' data points - in this case halfway between 48 and 68, and so the median is 58
</ul>
