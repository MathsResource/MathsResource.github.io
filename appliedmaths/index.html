Detailed Sections

1. Motion of a particle. Displacement, velocity as vectors. Applications of the vector addition law. Description of vectors in terms of unit perpendicular vectors. Elementary treatment of relative motion.
2. Newton’s laws. Mass, momentum. Acceleration and force as vectors. Units and dimensions.
3. Motion in a straight line under uniform acceleration e.g. motion under gravity, motion on smooth and rough inclined planes. Work, potential energy, kinetic energy, power. Application of energy conservation. Motion of connected particles.

4. Equilibrium of a particle under concurrent forces, including friction.
5. Centre of gravity of simple bodies and systems of particles Moments and couples. Equilibrium of a rigid body or bodies.
6. Liquid pressure. Thrust on a horizontal surface. Archimede’s Principle.

7. Projectiles. Projectiles on inclined plane.
8. Angular velocity. Uniform motion in a circle without gravitational forces. Conical pendulum. Circular orbits.
9. Conservation of momentum. Collisions. Direct collisions, elastic (0 < e ≤ 1) and inelastic (e = o). Oblique collisions of smooth elastic spheres in two dimensions.

10. Simple harmonic motion of a particle in a straight line. (Application of simple harmonic motion to include the simple pendulum.)
11. Motion of a rigid body about a fixed axis:
(a) Calculation of moments of inertia for a rod, rectangular lamina, circular lamina and compound bodies formed of those. (Sphere is excluded). Application of parallel and perpendicular axes theorems, with proofs done as classwork. Idea of radius of gyration. Application of the conservation of energy principle to a rotating body.

(b) Application of the principle of angular momentum: rate of change of angular momentum about a fixed axis equals the total external moment about that axis. Compound pendulum. Simple applications.
12. Ordinary differential equations and applications:
(a) first order, variables separable;
(b) Second order reducing to type (a)
