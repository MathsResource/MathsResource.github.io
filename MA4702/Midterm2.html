<ul>
	<li>Mid Term 2 is due to take place in Week 8 - in the Wednesday Lecture Slot.</li>
	<li>This exam is worth 15%.</li>
	<li>There are several grounds for requesting a postponement - but it is very very important to arrange this well in advance. Contact me for further details.</li>
	<li>Because the Maths Learning Centre Support classes are in operation - the <em><strong>cut off point</strong></em> is going to be much closer to the exam.</li>
</ul>

	<li><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Examinable Material</strong></span></li>
	<li>Examinable Material Starts with the Ratio Test On Page 24.</li>
	<li>Knowledge of <strong>factorials</strong> and <strong>power laws</strong> is expected.</li>
	<li>Some <strong>differentiation questions</strong> must be expected on this assessment, as they are relevant to Maclaurin Series.  We discussed the derivative of Hyperbolic functions also.</li>
	<li>Domain and Range of Functions</li>
	<li>Even and Odd Functions</li>
	<li>Composite Functions</li>
	<li>Inverse Functions</li>
	<li><em>(Hyperbolic Functions will not feature in this midterm - other than for differentiation questions. We are also skipping past pages 41-43 because we covered it already)</em></li>
	<li>Curve Sketching: X and Y intercepts.</li>
	<li><em>(Remember to state the actual points  i.e. (0,4) (3.5,0) etc.)</em></li>
	<li>The expected cut-off point is the first few topics of "Curve Sketching" - i.e. the Asymyptotes.2</li>
</ul>
