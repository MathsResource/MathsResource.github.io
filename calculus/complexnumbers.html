A <b>complex number</b> is a <b>number</b> that can be expressed in the form a + bi, where a and b are real <b>numbers</b> and i is the imaginary unit, that satisfies the equation x<sup>2</sup> = −1, that is, i<sup>2</sup> = −1. In this expression, a is the real part and b is the imaginary part of the <b>complex number</b>.
