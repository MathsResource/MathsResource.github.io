<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong></span>

On successful completion of this module, students should be able to:

1. Apply their mathematics and model and solve business problems using learned theory and techniques e.g. price/costs, supply and demand, marginal rates, production, consumer/producer surplus, investment flow, linear markets, market stability, optimisation, linear systems, input-output analysis.

2. Understand the concept of a function and recognise and graph the standard functions of the calculus including linear and quadratic functions; sine, cosine and tangent; log and exponential functions.

3. Calculate first and higher order derivatives of standard functions using the standard rules of differentiation.

4. Find and classify stationary points of a function of one or more variables.
