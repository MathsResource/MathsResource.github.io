Run Charts are basic trend charts that may be used with both variables (data that is both quantitative and continuous in measurement, such as a measured dimension or time) and attributes (count) data. The Run chart monitors the process location over time. Run Charts are NOT control charts, as they do not have statistical control limits. For that reason, they may not be used to establish statistical control of a process or to measure process capability.
<p>
<strong>When to Use a Run Chart</strong>

Run Charts are sometimes used when there is insufficient data to properly analyze a process using statistical control charts. They should never be used in place of control charts, and cannot offer the benefits of control charts (mainly that of ascertaining whether a process is in a state of statistical control, or to determine process capability).<p>
The x-axes are time based, so that the charts show a history of the process. For this reason, you must have data that is time-ordered; that is, entered in the sequence from which it was generated.<p>
Run Charts typically use three of the standard eight Western Electric / Nelson Run Tests Rules. These three rules provide a broad indication of process stability, but by themselves lack the sensitivity of statistical control charts.
