Attribute data is also known as "count" data. Typically, we will count the number of times we observe some condition (usually something we do not like, such as an error) in a given sample from the process. This is different from measurement data in its resolution. Attribute data has less resolution, since we only count if something occurs, rather than taking a measurement to see how close we are to the condition. For example, Attributes data for a health care process might include the number of patients with a fever, whereas Variables data for the same process might be the measurement of the patient temperature.

Thus, Attributes data generally provides us with less information than measurement (variables) data would for the same process. Thus, for attributes data, we will generally not be able to predict if the process is trending towards an undesirable state, since it is already in this condition.

<em><strong>Summary</strong></em>
<ul>
	<li>Attribute data is purely binary in nature. Good or Bad, Yes or No. No analysis can be performed on attribute data.</li>
	<li>Attribute data must be converted to a form of Variable data called<em><strong> discrete data</strong></em> in order to be counted or useful.</li>
	<li>Attribute data is qualitative data that can be counted for recording and analysis.</li>
	<li>Examples include the presence or absence of a required label, the installation of all required fasteners.</li>
	<li>Attribute data is not acceptable for production part submissions unless variable data cannot be obtained.</li>
	<li>The control charts based on attribute data are percent chart, number of affected units chart, count chart, count-per-unit chart, quality score chart and demerit chart.</li>
</ul>
